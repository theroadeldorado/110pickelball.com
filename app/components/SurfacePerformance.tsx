        "Clay is a softer, more forgiving surface that absorbs impact, which reduces ball speed and bounce height. A standard pickleball tends to bounce low on clay as some energy is lost into the soft ground. Our high-bounce pickleballs counteract clay's spongey effect with their added elasticity. They spring up ~10% higher, effectively restoring the bounce that clay courts steal.",

      title: 'Artificial Turf',
      description:
        "Turf (or artificial grass) courts tend to give a lower bounce â€“ much like real grass, the soft surface doesn't return energy to the ball efficiently. A standard pickleball can skid or die out on turf, making play challenging. High-bounce pickleballs are designed to compensate for turf's energy dissipation. Their extra rebound capability keeps the bounce height closer to what you'd expect on a hard court.",

      title: 'Cushioned Courts',
      description:
        'Many indoor courts or cushioned acrylic surfaces have an underlying rubber/foam pad for shock absorption. While great for joints, this padding slows the game with a noticeably lower bounce because it soaks up impact energy. Our high-bounce pickleballs negate that effect by returning more energy to the bounce. Instead of the ball "sticking" to a cushioned floor, it springs off it.',

    },
    {
      title: 'Tile Courts',
      description:
        'Modular tile surfaces (interlocking plastic court tiles) often have slight flex and seams that can create "dead spots." If a ball lands where a tile isn\'t fully supported, the tile flexes and absorbs impact, resulting in a low or altered bounce. 110% Pickleballs help overcome those dead spots. The balls\' extra elasticity pushes back against the flexing tile, producing a higher rebound even on sections of the court that normally dampen the bounce.',
